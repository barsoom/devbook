# How we work

We are little-a agile. That means we are always trying to improve how we work, but we don't subscribe to any particular methodology (Scrum, XP, â€¦).

We use the practices that work for us, namely:

#### Test-driven development.

We try to work test-first.

We aim for 100% code coverage. Not because that guarantees a perfect test suite, but because the coverage reports help us find dead code and other things we miss.

#### Collective code ownership.

While it's fine that different developers gravitate towards different things, no developer should be the only person that knows how to do any particular thing.

If we notice that the same person always does the same task because no one else knows how to, we "forbid" them from doing it the next time.

We also try to automate or at least document common tasks to help spread the knowledge.

#### Continuous deployment.

We deploy several times a day.

Any difference between development and production is a liability. Small and frequent changes means smaller failures when they happen.

#### Open source.

We use a lot of open source, contribute patches and release [libs of our own](http://github.com/barsoom).

If a problem is not too particular to the app we're working on, and does not represent an important competitive advantage for that business, we encourage extracting and sharing it.

#### Post mortems in a blame-free environment.

The important thing when something goes wrong is to figure out why it happened and how to all learn from that, not to assign blame.

#### Leaving some slack.

We don't plan all of our time, leaving some slack. It counters stress and leads to a higher level of polish.

We try to spend at least an hour or two every morning fixing things we want to fix: tools, visual polish, fun features, improve workflows, refactoring, documents like this one etc.

And when we do planned tasks, we try to have enough slack to do them well the first time.

#### Some code review.

We don't review all code all the time; we prefer to "move fast and break things".

We do review some changes, when breaking things would be unacceptable. At those times, we use GitHub pull requests.

All commits are shown and linked in our chatroom, so there is also some spontaneous post-merge review from that.

#### Some pair programming.

We pair program to spread knowledge or for problems that don't easily fit inside one head.

But we don't always pair program, as the flow and speed of the lone developer is hard to beat.

Sometimes we do "distributed pair programming" where two or more developers work on different parts of the same task, so they can consult each other without any major context switching.
