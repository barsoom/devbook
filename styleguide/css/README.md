# CSS and Sass styleguide

Also see [the general styleguide](/styleguide).

---
### CSS

#### Use `0` without a unit for zero values.

Rather than `0px`, `0em` etc. Not a big deal, but it's the common convention, and less to type.


---
### Sass

#### Use hyphens in multiple-word variable names.

So `$foo-bar: 123px;`

This is the style used in the Sass documentation.
