# JavaScript Styleguide

## CoffeeScript

Avoid it.

Try not to add more to projects that already use it. (Though it's fine if that's easier.)

## Tooling

### Avoid jQuery

Don't add jQuery to new projects. You probably don't need it.

Try not to add more to projects that already use it. (Though it's fine if that's easier.)

Prefer vanilla JS or let something like React handle the DOM for you.

In projects where we already use jQuery, it's fine to keep using it, but consider it legacy and something we want to get away from.

### Avoid lodash

You probably don't need it â€“ see ["Avoid jQuery"](#avoid-jquery).

If you do use it, import only the functions you need, like this:

``` javascript
import foo from 'lodash/foo'
```

Don't do this, because [it will make tree-shaking impossible](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2019/03/07/lessons-on-tree-shaking-lodash/):

``` javascript
import { foo } from 'lodash'
import _ from 'lodash'
```

### Use Prettier

Use our [prettier-config](https://github.com/barsoom/prettier-config)

### Use eslint

Use [eslint-config-barsoom](https://github.com/barsoom/eslint-config-barsoom)

### When using Babel

Try to avoid using too many experimental features.

Stage 3 is fine and stage 2 can be OK.

Just don't go crazy with everything shiny and new that is likely to change, or maybe not even get into the standard.

### Dependencies

Avoid adding npm dependencies for simple things.

It might be tempting to add a dependency for something, but if it's simple enough it's probably better to implement it yourself. (Looking at you, [left-pad](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/)).

## Code style

### Regular functions vs. arrow functions

Use `function` for named functions and arrow functions for unnamed closures.
The reason for this is that `function foo` easier to read (less syntax).

``` javascript
const foo = () => {
  // Avoid this
}

function foo() {
  // When you can do this
}
```

Use arrows for functions that are passed as callbacks, since arrow functions bind `this` automatically.

If you're using function-style components in React, you (usually) don't need `this`, so it's better to use named functions because they are easier to read. But always prefer arrows instead of `.bind(this)`, and for unnamed closures.

## React

TODO: Merge this with [our React styleguide](/styleguide/react). That guide may be outdated and uses CoffeeScript.

### Wrap your app in `<React.StrictMode>`

This will enable some extra warnings in development mode.

[React.js docs about Strict Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html)

### PropTypes

Read [Typechecking With PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html).

Our eslint rules will complain if you don't use them.

### Callback names

Prop names for callbacks and events should be called `onSomething`, like `onClick` or `onMouseOver` etc.

Example:

``` jsx
function Question({ onAccept, onDismiss, message }) {
  return (
    <div className={styles.question}>
      <p>{message}</p>
      <button onClick={onAccept}>Accept</button>
      <button onClick={onDismiss}>Dismiss</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Event handlers should be called `handleSomething`, like `handleClick`, `handleMouseOver` etc.

Example:

``` jsx
function MyComponent() {
  function handleAccept() {
    alert("Accepted!")
  }

  function handleDecline() {
    alert("Declined!")
  }

  return (
    <Question
      message="Do you want to continue?"
      onAccept={handleAccept}
      onDecline={handleDecline}
    />
  )
}
```

### File structure

Name the file after the default export, so that `MyAwesomeComponent.js` exports the component `MyAwesomeComponent`.

Try to use 1 component for each file, especially if they have a lot of logic that can be separated.
It's OK to have multiple components in one file if they are closely related.
