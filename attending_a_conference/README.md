# Attending a conference

Things we might want to remember when the company sends us to a conference.


## Before

* Bring company t-shirt
* Bring any relevant job ads in case there's a job board


## During

* Wear company t-shirt
* Tweet that we're there using the conference hashtag, [e.g. like this](https://twitter.com/gocardless/status/576401302302896128)
* Post job ads if applicable


## After

* Discuss and evaluate the conference with coworkers
