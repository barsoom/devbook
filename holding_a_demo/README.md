# Holding a demo

We like to do demos to evaluate our products as we work on them. This is a checklist for those.

* Appoint someone in charge of making this demo session happen
* Announce a time, place and duration and respect it (so we don't waste anyone's time)
* Plan the specific scenarios we want to run through
* A pre-demo with only devs can be good to catch obvious bugs
* Invite stakeholders and make it clear that we want their input
* Try to get stakeholders involved in realistic scenarios to discover real issues
* Take notes, make tickets
