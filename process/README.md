# Process conventions


## Timeout

We've agreed to a "timeout" convention, where you can make a "T" with your hands (or say "timeout", in an audio conference).

This is intended as a shorthand to move us along â€“ since we've all agreed on it and made it conventional, the idea is that it's instantly understood and respected, without taking offense at the brevity.

In a stand-up or other meeting, it means "enough detail, let's get back on track".

For a conversation taking place in our work room, it means "would you please end this conversation or take it elsewhere".


## Stand-up

We agreed on following these stand-up conventions

* Everyone reports what they were doing the workday before,
* what they plan on doing next and
* what's blocking them.

* The facilitator chooses how starts
* Everyone has approx. one minute
* Topics which are up for longer/in-depth discussions are noted and discussed in post-stand-up or in a separate meeting
