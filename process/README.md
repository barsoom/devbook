# Process conventions

## Shape Up

Since circa March 2022, we're trying out a take on the [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) process.

These are some of the tools we've adopted, changed or bolted on:

- A 4 week cycle focusing on planned work, avoiding distractions such as non-urgent maintenance.
- Followed by a 2 week cooldown, where we:
  - Finish up if we didn't get done during cycle. (But we should aggressively scope down to avoid this.)
  - Do bug fixes and smaller improvements to the cycle work based on feedback. (But major stuff should be planned for a future cycle. And ideally we should ship iteratively to get feedback during the cycle.)
    - After the first cooldown, the implementing group no longer "owns" it, and any further bugs would be handled by [the hatter](/hatter), though they can of course delegate to or consult those with more context.
  - Have a retro.
  - Schedule things like interviews, if we can avoid planning them mid-cycle.
  - Have lab time, scratching itches and trying out new things.
  - Do routine maintenance on our projects. (We have split out our projects between us for routine updates of Gems, NPM packages, language versions and such.)
  - Do track work, where our area-of-interest groups (maintenance, tooling, security, frontend, architecture etc) discuss priorities, pitch to the product team, or just fix it then and there.

## Timeout

We've agreed to a "timeout" convention, where you can make a "T" with your hands (or say "timeout", in an audio conference).

In a stand-up or other meeting, it means "enough detail, let's get back on track".

For a conversation taking place in our work room, it means "would you please end this conversation or take it elsewhere".

By agreeing on a shorthand, the idea is that we can be brief without anyone taking offense at the brevity.


## Stand-up

We agreed on following these stand-up conventions

* Everyone reports what they were doing the workday before,
* what they plan on doing next and
* what's blocking them.

* The facilitator chooses who starts
* Everyone has approx. one minute
* Topics which are up for longer/in-depth discussions are noted and discussed in post-stand-up or in a separate meeting
