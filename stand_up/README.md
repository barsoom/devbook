# Stand-up rules

We agreed on following these stand-up conventions

* Everyone reports what they were doing the workday before,
* what they plan on doing next and
* what's blocking them.

* The facilitator chooses who starts
* Everyone has approx. one minute
* Topics which are up for longer/in-depth discussions are noted and discussed in post-stand-up or in a separate meeting
