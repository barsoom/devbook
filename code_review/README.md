# Code review guidelines

**2014-06-25** Very much a work in progress at the moment.

We review all code commit-by-commit after the fact using [Remit](https://github.com/henrik/remit/).

Committers and reviewers should read these guidelines to do it better.


## As a committer

### Make your code or commit message clear enough that the reviewer doesn't have to wonder unnecessarily.

Did you put an English translation in the German translation file while you wait to receive copy?

The reviewer can't tell if you simply forgot.

So say e.g. "DE translation coming." in the commit message summary.
