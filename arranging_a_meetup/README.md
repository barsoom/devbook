* Tools (ticket tracker, chat, deploy, review)


## Traditional meetup

### Do

* Promote the meetup on Twitter

### Around the HQ

#### Ahead of time

* Buy drinks the day before so they are nice and chilly in time
* Clear fridge, chill drinks
* Set out garbage bins/trash bags
* Empty garbage bins

* Prepare a board for job postings

* Bottle opener (and somewhere to throw caps)
* Make sure we have wifi; post details
* Helpful notes: drink fridge, bathroom, food and snacks (vegetarian, allergies)
* Blankets if we're going to be outdoors when it's chilly

#### Just before

* Lock unused offices
* Move desks
* Arrange chairs
* Set out snacks
* Hide secrets (maps, whiteboards…)
* Make sure the dashboards are pretty ;)

#### During

* If the meetup goes on after 21.00, the alarm will go off (make sure you remember your code!)

#### For an Open Space

* Prepare sheets, pens and a board for topics
* Prepare a room map

### Buy

* Buy disposable plates
* Buy disposable mugs
* Buy alcoholic beverages (~3 per head).
  Heavy! 25 people = 60 beers + some non-alcoholic = 4 people to carry.
* Buy non-alcoholic beverages
* Buy snacks/fruit

### Order

* Food (pizza, wraps).
  - At least 1/3 vegetarian.
  - From somewhere close or the delivery time can be unreliable. (We've been bitten by this twice.)
    - If the food is cold (e.g. wraps), we might as well get it delivered a few hours ahead of time.
  - 16 pizzas for ~24 people seemed like just enough.
  - We have used [online pizza/pizza hut](http://onlinepizza.se/Stockholm/Pizza-Hut-Klaraberg) and ordered large pizzas (8 slices) (2-3 slices per attendee).

### Responsibilities during the meetup

#### Example introduction

Welcome. Barsoom is a Rails development shop, …. We're hiring.

Practical: bathroom is there, pizza arrives at X.

Open space: topics on a board with M rooms and N time slots.

Point out rooms.

Feel free to move topics around, to repeat them, to remove your own or add new ones if you have an interesting discussion in the breaks.

One important law, the Law of Two Feet:

"If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else." You have the right and the responsibility to maximize your own learning and contribution. Don't waste time. Don't be offended if this happens.
