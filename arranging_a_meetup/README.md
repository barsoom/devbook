#### Example introduction

Welcome. Barsoom is a Rails development shop, …. We're hiring.

Practical: bathroom is there, pizza arrives at X.

Open space: topics on a board with M rooms and N time slots.

Point out rooms.

Feel free to move topics around, to repeat them, to remove your own or add new ones if you have an interesting discussion in the breaks.

One important law, the Law of Two Feet:

"If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else." You have the right and the responsibility to maximize your own learning and contribution. Don't waste time. Don't be offended if this happens.
