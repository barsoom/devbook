# Wiki conventions

We use GitHub wikis to document project-specific things as well all company information that can't be public (i.e. in this devbook).

They easily become a mess, so here are some conventions:

* The first page of every wiki should start with an explanation of its role and links to other related wikis or documents.
* When you organize the pages, ask yourself where you did (or would) look for it.
* New texts should be in US English. Translate any old, Swedish texts when possible.
* Delete no-longer-relevant pages when you can. Wikis are repos with history, so it's not lost.
* If a page is outdated but you can't confidently delete it, link to it from one page only, named `Old pages`.
