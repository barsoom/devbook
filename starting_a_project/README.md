# Starting a project

A basic checklist for starting a new project.

## Talk within the team

* What problems are we intending to solve?
* Figure out which stakeholders we can talk to.
* Discuss non-functional requirements, which ones apply, which does not, how does this affect the project? Security, Usability, Performance, Scaling, ...
* Any new technologies we want to use on this project?
* Make sure everyone becomes familiar with the technologies we're planning to use. Do a workshop, watch presentations, discuss.
* Get a shared understanding within the team of what we're proposing to build.
  - Discuss scenarios
  - Draw on whiteboard
  - ...

## Talk to the stakeholders

* Talk to the stakeholders about the project and our initial ideas.
* Incorporate any feedback we get.
* Define a goal for iteration 1. Preferably something that can be demoed.
* Take notes and improve this document.

## Iteration 0

* Set up a development environment.
* Get a walking skeleton going early for shared understanding and get basic technical issues out of the way.
* Set up CI.
* Set up deploy to staging and production.
* Set up exception monitoring.
* Set up dashboard.
* Spend time on automating and documenting as much as possible to make this faster next time.

## Iteration 1 to n

* Implement goal.
* [Demo it](https://github.com/barsoom/devbook/tree/master/holding_a_demo).
* Adjust as necessary.
* Are we done? If not, define a new goal.
