# Deploy without downtime

We deploy without downtime when we can to avoid user frustration. It's pretty rare that we can't.

There's a great [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6bVTthtnZ0)/[slideshow](https://github.com/barsoom/devbook/tree/master/deploy_without_downtime) on this, but no convenient reference that we're aware of â€“ hence this document.

## Terminology

We call a revision/migration "safe" if it can be deployed without downtime.

The application before a deploy is the "old app". The application after a deploy is the "new app".

## Considerations

### Requests

* TODO

### Assets

* TODO

### Database

* A migration is only safe if the old app works with the new state of the DB.

* TODO
